# MegaResearcher

A Claude Code plugin that runs a small group of research subagents against a research question and produces a research direction document: hypotheses, falsification criteria, experimental designs, and a record of the ideas that were rejected along the way.

## Example runs

Two real runs are committed in this repo, including spec, plan, every per-worker subdirectory, swarm state, and verification report. Nothing is post-processed for the demo.

| Topic | Pipeline | What's in the output |
|---|---|---|
| **[Recursive reasoning on subquadratic-attention backbones](docs/research/examples/recursive-subquadratic-fusion/run-2026-05-10-0729-766039/output.md)** | Full hypothesis pipeline — 5 scouts + 2 gap-finders + 6 hypothesis-smiths × 2 rounds + 6 red-team × 2 rounds + 5 eval-designers + synthesist (**38 worker invocations**) | 5 surviving hypotheses with mechanism, falsification criteria, and experimental designs; 1 hypothesis killed by red-team and preserved with the reasoning that killed it |
| **[Multi-modal ISR fusion landscape](docs/research/examples/multimodal-fusion-gap-finding/run-2026-05-10-0615-0ece4e/output.md)** | Gap-finding only — 6 scouts + 3 gap-finders + synthesist (**10 worker invocations**) | 4 load-bearing gaps converged on by independent gap-finders; 8-candidate shortlist with explicit licence-driven discards; 3 top picks spanning 3 deployment contexts |

## What it does

You write a one-paragraph research question. The plugin walks you through a brainstorm, drafts a spec, drafts a plan, and (once you approve both) runs a six-phase swarm:

1. `literature-scout` — one per sub-topic, builds an annotated bibliography
2. `gap-finder` — partitions the bibliography, looks for unexplored intersections
3. `hypothesis-smith` — one per gap, forges a testable hypothesis
4. `red-team` — adversarial critique loop, up to 3 revisions per hypothesis
5. `eval-designer` — one per surviving hypothesis, designs the experiment
6. `synthesist` — composes the final document

The orchestrator that runs these waves is a skill (`executing-research-plan`) that runs in the main session, not a subagent. Claude Code doesn't allow nested agent dispatch, so the orchestrator has to live where it can call `Task`.

## Output

Each run writes to `docs/research/` in the project you're working in:

```
docs/research/
├── specs/
│   └── 2026-05-10-multimodal-fusion-spec.md
├── plans/
│   └── 2026-05-10-multimodal-fusion-plan.md
└── runs/
    └── 2026-05-10-1430-a3f9b2/
        ├── output.md                  # the deliverable
        ├── swarm-state.yaml           # what ran, when, and what it produced
        ├── verification-report.md     # spot-checks
        ├── bibliography.md            # consolidated Phase 1
        ├── gaps.md                    # consolidated Phase 2
        ├── literature-scout-1/
        ├── gap-finder-1/
        ├── hypothesis-smith-1/        # includes revision history
        ├── red-team-1/                # verdict + objections + spot-checks
        ├── eval-designer-1/
        └── ...
```

`output.md` is self-contained. It includes an executive summary, the surviving hypotheses (mechanism, predicted outcome, falsification criteria, experimental design), the rejected hypotheses with the reasoning behind each rejection, a section listing what the spec's YAGNI fence intentionally left out, and a recommended next action.

## The red-team loop

Every hypothesis goes through critique from an independent agent that:

- Re-runs the literature query and rejects the gap claim if it finds prior work the gap-finder missed
- Spot-checks at least three citations against the actual papers (`hf_papers paper_details`)
- Attacks the mechanism step by step, demanding citations for causal claims
- Steelmans the strongest counter-argument
- Tests whether the falsification criteria can actually be operationalized
- Tags each objection `Critical | Important | Suggestion`

If the hypothesis-smith can't satisfy the red-team within 3 rounds, it escalates to you. Rejected hypotheses are recorded in `output.md` along with the reasoning that rejected them.

## Workflow

```
/research-init
   ↓
research-brainstorming        clarifies novelty target, modalities, constraints
   ↓
writing-research-spec         writes docs/research/specs/<date>-<topic>-spec.md
   ↓                          you review + approve
writing-research-plan         writes docs/research/plans/<date>-<topic>-plan.md
   ↓                          you review + approve
/research-execute
   ↓
executing-research-plan       runs the six phases
   ↓
research-verification         evidence-based completion gate
   ↓
output.md
```

There are three approval gates before execution starts.

## Built on superpowers

MegaResearcher depends on the [`superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin and calls its skills directly. If superpowers isn't installed, `executing-research-plan` will refuse to run.

## Install

Requirements: Claude Code, `uv`, the [`superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin, and a Hugging Face token.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lhqezio/MegaResearcher.git ~/MegaResearcher
cd ~/MegaResearcher/mcp && uv sync

cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env
# HF_TOKEN required; GITHUB_TOKEN optional
```

Wire it into Claude Code in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "superpowers@claude-plugins-official": true,
    "megaresearcher@megaresearcher": true
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "megaresearcher": {
      "source": { "source": "directory", "path": "/Users/you/MegaResearcher" }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code, then from any project:

```
/research-init multi-modal fusion architectures for ISR
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|:---:|---|
| `HF_TOKEN`                    | yes | HF API access (papers, datasets, docs, repo files) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`                | no  | GitHub API access; without it the three GitHub tools surface a clean error |
| `ML_INTERN_TRACES_REPO`       | no  | `<your-hf-username>/ml-intern-sessions` to enable trace upload to a private HF dataset |
| `ML_INTERN_TRACES_PRIVATE`    | no  | `true` (default) or `false` for that dataset's visibility |
| `MEGARESEARCHER_MAX_PARALLEL` | no  | Max parallel workers per phase, default 4 |

## Rules the workers enforce

- Every rejected hypothesis is recorded in `output.md` along with the reasoning that rejected it.
- Cited arxiv IDs are validated via `hf_papers paper_details`. Citations that don't resolve are dropped.
- Hypotheses without a finite experiment that could disprove them are not advanced.
- Eval-designers pre-register what result counts as support and what counts as falsification before the experiment is described.
- Workers don't cross roles: scouts produce bibliographies, smiths produce hypotheses, designers produce experiments, the synthesist composes.

## Built on

- [`huggingface/ml-intern`](https://github.com/huggingface/ml-intern) — the research tools (HF Papers, arxiv, datasets, docs, GitHub code search, web search), the doom-loop detector, and the trace upload pipeline. Vendored as a pinned snapshot.
- [`superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — the discipline layer: spec-driven planning, parallel agent dispatch, verification, code review patterns. Hard dependency.
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — the runtime.
